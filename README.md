# Firefox-Extension
WebExtensions are a way to write browser extensions: that is, programs installed inside a web browser that modify the behaviour of the browser or of web pages loaded by the browser.
# Installation
Open Firefox and load about:debugging in the URL bar. Click the Load Temporary Add-on button and select the manifest.json file within the directory of an example extension you'd like to install.
